# Acmegrade_Internship-Projects
These are my projects that I had completed during my Internship in Data Science Domain (Machine Learning) Via Acmegrade.

Thrilled to showcase two standout projects I worked on during my Internship at Acmegrade! 🌐💻

1️⃣ Breast-Cancer Prediction:
Delved into the world of predictive modeling to develop a Machine Learning Model for Breast-Cancer Prediction. Leveraging data science and machine learning, this project aims to revolutionize the way for developing a best machine learning model (based on significant metrics) which ables to predict Breast-Cancer at an early stage.

➡ I had used different ML models(Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Clasifier, Random Forest Classifier, XG-Boost, Ada-Boost) among these Logistic Regression, SVM and AdaBoost have the best scores with 97.7%, 95.3%, 95.3%. For getting better results I had done Feature Engineering over Logistic Regression which provided me an accuracy of 98%.

2️⃣ Movie Recommendation System:
Dive into the magic of cinema with our Movie Recommendation System!! This project explores the realms of collaborative filtering and personalized recommendations to enhance the movie-watching experience.

➡ In this project i had use the 𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 to figure out the similarity between the movies according to inputs entered by 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿.

Software Used: Python 3.7, Deepnote, Windows 11 OS
Dataset Used: Cancer_Data.csv, Movies.csv
